# Analysis-of-Crimes-in-Chicago

In this project, I aim to perform Exploratory Data Analysis to the crimes data of Chicago to gain a better understanding of the patterns and trends of criminal activity in the city.
There are several reasons why we should care about the crimes taking place in Chicago. First, crime has a significant impact on the safety and well-being of residents, particularly those who live in high-crime neighborhoods. Second, crime can have a negative impact on the city's economy, as businesses may be hesitant to invest in areas with high crime rates. Finally, understanding crime patterns can help law enforcement agencies develop more effective strategies for preventing and reducing crime.
By exploring previous crime data, we can gain insights into the types of crimes that are most prevalent in certain areas, the times, and days when crimes are most likely to occur, and the demographics of both victims and perpetrators. This information can be used to develop predictive models that can help law enforcement agencies allocate resources more effectively and prevent future crimes.

**Research Questions:**
1. How accurately can we predict the likelihood of an arrest being made for a particular crime in Chicago based on various variables, such as the type of crime, location, month, and day?
2. Is there a significant interaction between the type of crime and its location in determining the likelihood of a case being solved in Chicago?
3. How does the overall trend of crime in Chicago vary across different months in the year 2022? Are there any seasonal patterns in the data?
4. Are there any specific types of crime that are more likely to be solved in Chicago?
5. How does the location of a crime impact the likelihood of an arrest being made in Chicago?
